	<h3> Who am I? <h3>	<br>
   <p>  Well I'd love to tell you! <br><br>
As you probably figured out my name is Danny, and I'm the designer and developer of this website!<br>
I'm an engineer who's very interested in all aspects of web design and development from initial concepts through to coding and function!</p>
	  <br><br>
<h3>Why did I make this website?</h3>
	  <p>I made this website for two reasons:<br>
	  <ul>
		<li>1. To have a portfolio to showcase my developer experience and capabilities. </li>	
		<li>2. To collect all my recipes in one place that I can share with my friends and family where.</li>
	  </ul></p>
	  <br><br>
	  <h3>WHAT DO I LIKE ABOUT WEB DESIGN?</h3><br>
	 <p> I enjoy using the correct pieces of code together to get the output on the screen that creates something aesthetically pleasing whilst being fully functional.</p>
